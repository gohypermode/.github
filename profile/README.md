## What is Hypermode?

Hypermode is a toolkit for building AI-powered frontends.

The toolkit consists of an SDK, an inference engine, and a datastore. With an SDK of shorthand methods for requesting inferences from your AI models, the engine allows you to chain together different services in the programming language you're most comfortable with. This is all enabled by a fully managed vector-graph datastore with model management, embedding automation, and analytics built-in.

## Who is Hypermode for?

Hypermode is made for frontend developers.

Our team has made multiple products for frontend developers. The top problems are always the same: you need to ship faster, you need to deliver a blazing fast Â® UX, and you need security to sign off.

You can trust Hypermode to deliver on all three.
